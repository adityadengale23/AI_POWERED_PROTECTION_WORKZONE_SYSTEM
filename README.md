# 🤖 AI Powered Robotic Protection Zone

## AI + IoT Based Industrial Safety System

## 📌 Overview

An intelligent safety system designed for industrial robotic zones that ensures:

- Only authorized personnel can enter
- Mandatory PPE compliance
- Automatic machinery shutdown when humans are inside

## ⚙️ Features

- AI-based PPE Detection (Helmet + Vest)
- Password Authentication using Keypad
- Automated Gate Control using Servo Motors
- IR Sensor for Entry Detection
- Automatic Machinery Shutdown System
- People Counting Mechanism (IN / OUT)
- LED Status Indicator (System ON / OFF)

## 🧠 System Working

### Working Prototype of Project

**Watch Demo**

### 1. PPE Detection
- Camera captures the person
- Python AI model checks for helmet and safety vest

### 2. Authentication
- User enters password using keypad

### 3. Gate Access
If PPE + Password are correct:
- Gates open automatically

### 4. Entry Detection
- IR sensor detects entry
- Gates close immediately

### 5. Safety Shutdown
- Machinery turns OFF when a person enters the zone

### 6. Smart Restart Logic

System tracks:
- IN Count
- OUT Count

System condition:
- IN = OUT → System ON
- IN ≠ OUT → System OFF
